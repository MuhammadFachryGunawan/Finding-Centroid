# Finding-Centroid

generates random values for two variables x1 and x2, and creates a Pandas DataFrame called df to store these values. The DataFrame df has three columns: x1, x2, and class (1 or 2).
then creates another DataFrame called cent_df to store centroid values. It initializes this DataFrame with the first two values from x1 and x2 as centroid coordinates. It also adds an "iteration" column with values ranging from 0 to 4
